    <section>

        <h3>Do you need to see my boat to give me a quotation?</h3>
        <h2>Although we don't necessarily require an in-person viewing of your boat to provide a quotation, we highly recommend sharing pictures of the boat as they are extremely valuable in enabling us to provide an accurate quotation. With detailed pictures, we can ensure that all necessary factors are taken into account, resulting in an accurate and comprehensive quotation.</h2>

        <h3>Can we copy an old existing cover?</h3>
        <h2>We are unable to manufacture a cover without obtaining the boat's required measurements first. This is due to the fact that canvas material has a tendency to shrink and degrade over time, and we cannot guarantee a precise fit by replicating an old cover.</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>What material do you offer?</h3>
